## COVID-19 Cases in Toronto: Exploring epidemic impacts among different age groups
The novel coronavirus has been around for over a year; 2020 witnessed an ongoing global epidemic that has cost countless lives and jobs and systematically disrupted the development of human society in almost every aspect. Taking the Toronto data as one sampled data point from many of the global epicenters, this paper intends to conduct a case study on COVID-19. More specifically, the study investigates the epidemic impacts of COVID-19 on people from different age groups in order to inform the general public of its risk to further educate them for better precautions in disease prevention.
